<p>While computational methods in medical imaging have enabled us to detect and assess cancerous tumors and assist in their treatment, early detection of cancer precursors provides us with an opportunity for its early treatment and prevention. The survival rate of cancer is still low, and largely depends on the affected organ and how early it is diagnosed. The variable nature of the disease in different patients and the diverse imaging acquisition types involved for quantification of disease and treatment demands robust method designs. It is therefore critical to develop generalizable methods as part of a holistic early cancer detection ecosystem -- including different data analysis methods for various modalities and optimizing cross-modality fusion for improved detection and prognosis. </p>
